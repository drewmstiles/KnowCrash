ID,Item,Page,Pre-Conditions,Post-Conditions,Inputs,Outputs,Pass/Fail Criteria,Assumptions,Dependencies,Implementation,Status
01,Graphic render time,Historical Spatial Visualizatoin,none,none,none,Integer denoting page load duration (seconds),(page render time) < 2 seconds,Minimal network latency,none,Selenium,failing
02,Animation transition time between historical years,Historical Spatial Visualizatoin,On historical spatial view page,none,none,Integer denoting year transition duration (seconds),(year transition time) < 2 seconds,Minimal network latency 

All years have same overhead,none,Selenium,passing
03,Accident severity marker/filter correspondence,Historical Spatial Visualizatoin,Viewing historical spatial data for some year,none,none,Boolean denoting correspondence between visible markers and filter,For every visible marker it’s color matches the filtered severity,Page has loaded at check time,none,Selenium,passing
04,Accident cause marker/filter correspondence,Historical Spatial Visualizatoin,Viewing historical spatial data for some year,none,none,Boolean denoting correspondence between visible markers and filter,For every visible marker it’s cause matches the filtered cause,Page has loaded at check time,none,Selenium,passing
05,Server load testing,Home,none,none,none,Boolean denoting server status while under load > 1000 requests per second,Server continues to return HTTP 200 at peak load of 1000 request per second,All infrastructure currently up and running,none,JMeter,
06,Animation transition time,Historical Spatial Visualizatoin

Historical Abstract Visualizatoin,Viewing historical spatial data for some year,none,none,Integer denoting transition duration (-1 if incomplete),(transition duration) > 0 seconds & (transition duration) < 2 seconds,none,none,Selenium,passing
07,Graphic render time,Future Spatial Visualizatoin,none,none,none,Integer denoting page load duration (seconds),(page render time) < 2 seconds,Minimal network latency,none,Selenium,passing
08,Animation transition time between today’s hours,Future Spatial Visualizatoin,On future spatial view page,none,none,Integer hour transition (seconds),(hour transition time) < 2 seconds,Minimal network latency 

All hours have same overhead,none,Selenium,passing
09,Accident prediction validation,Future Spatial Visualizatoin,On future spatial view page,none,none,Boolean denoting whether or not all predictions fall between 0.0 - 1.0 (0% - 100%),All predictions inside valid range (0.0-1.0),There exists one prediction to validate against,none,Selenium,
10,Live condition accuracy validation,Future Spatial Visualizatoin,Accidents from day under consideration have been rendered on future spatial visualization,none,none,Boolean denoting the correspondence between rendered accident’s and real-time data source

CSV file containing current accidents for day,All accidents being display on visualization have matching entry in data source,Data source is readily available at anytime,CHP Traffic Website https://cad.chp.ca.gov/Traffic.aspx,Selenium and UNIX Cron,
